# asymmetry
My attempt at asymmetry measurements. I am trying to use 90 degree rotation (because it should be correlated with eccentricity) to calibrate the code. However, the parameter that is cited most often in the literature is 180 degree rotation. Some of the main challenges have been getting the minimum asymmetry values for stamps with multiple galaxies and background estimation, which can be more robust than I have attmepted so far.
